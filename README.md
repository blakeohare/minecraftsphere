# Minecraft Sphere Generator

Generate sphere approximations in a 3D grid. 

Good for building domes in minecraft or whatever your preferred voxel medium is. 

This is just some hacky nonsense I threw together and thought might be useful to someone. 

Known bug: leaves gaps  when the slope is not steep enough between slice layers.
